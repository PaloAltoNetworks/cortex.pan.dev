Having the right library or SDK for the job can make a world of difference, especially as it pertains to jumpstarting productivity and following best practices. Having the wrong library (or no library at all!) can force you to spend precious hours working on the foundational boilerplate code your app needs to interact with the Cortex Data Lake APIs.

The Developer Relations team has felt this pain before and wishes for no one else to have to experience it for themselves. For that reason, our team of [Trash PANDAs](https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/introducing-developer-relations-at-palo-alto-networks-c9b4a8817c4) maintains a collection of libraries, tools and SDKs intended to help enable your next Cortex Data Lake app or integration.

## Libaries and SDKs

From "Hello ðŸŒŽ" to "Hello ðŸ’°", and everything in between.
