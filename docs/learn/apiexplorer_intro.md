:::info
API Explorer is a simple, yet powerful, Cortex Data Lake application created to empower developers at any stage of their journey.

Use it to:

- **Explore** the data available in your CDL
- **Test** and refine SQL queries
- **Learn** how to parse API responses
- **Authenticate** with Developer Tokens
- **Play** in the sandbox environment

:::

## Query Explorer

The Query Explorer provides a GUI-driven way to explore your Cortex Data Lake using SQL statements. When possible, API Explorer will return results in both `tabular` and raw, `JSON` format.

Not sure what SQL statements to start with? Select something from the provided Sample Query library to help get your creative juices flowing.

## Secure Access to _Your_ Data

API Explorer ships with full OAuth2 support, allowing you to delegate access to _your_ data.

## Sandbox

Each instance of API Explorer comes with a pre-authorized sandbox environment, curated and maintained by the [Developer Relations](https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/introducing-developer-relations-at-palo-alto-networks-c9b4a8817c4) team. In it, you'll find simulated, sample data across many different log types - hopefully enough to give you a sense of what's possible!

## Developer Tokens

Working on a proof-of-concept or exploring the API? Not quite ready to jump into implementing the full OAuth2 authorization code grant flow? Not to worry - API Explorer is here to help. Leave the OAuth2 stuff to API Explorer and generate a `Developer Token` to ease the process of authenticating to the CDL APIs.
